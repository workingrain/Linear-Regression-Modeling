# Linear-Regression-Modeling

#### RESEARCH QUESTION
What factors contribute significantly to the variability in additional charges incurred by the patients?
#### GOALS
The objective of this analysis is to improve patient financial planning. Patients benefit from knowing what factors contribute to additional charges. This can help them make informed decisions about their healthcare and plan for potential expenses. It enhances transparency and reduces financial surprises for patients. 

#### SUMMARY OF ASSUMPTIONS
There are several assumptions for multiple linear regression. These assumptions are needed for the model to be valid and for the statistical inferences to be accurate. These are the four key assumptions to keep in mind. 
Firstly, the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is assumed to be linear. The changes in the independent variables are associated with the constant change in the dependent variable. Secondly, the residuals should be independent of each other. The residual value for one observation should not be related to the residual for further observation. Thirdly, the variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. Lastly, residuals should have a normal distribution. This is especially essential for smaller sample sizes to ensure the validity of statistical tests and confidence intervals. 
#### TOOL BENEFITS
For this analysis, I used R. This language has several data-cleaning features and capabilities. 
Firstly, R has a vast ecosystem of packages designed explicitly for data cleaning. In this assessment, naniar, dplyr, and plyr packages were used. Naniar was used for finding missing data. Dplyr was used for data manipulation and analysis. Plyr was used to convert and revalue variables. All these packages were essential to accomplish a clean dataset. 
Lastly, R has easy-to-use data visualization capabilities. Visualization can aid in identifying outliers, missing values, and patterns between variables. 
#### APPROPRIATE BENEFIT
Multiple linear regression is an appropriate technique to find the factors that affect additional charges incurred by patients for numerous reasons. 
Firstly, my research question involves understanding the impact of multiple factors on additional charges. Multiple linear regression allows the manipulation of more than one independent variable to capture the complex relationships among various factors. Moreover, multiple linear regression can help identify which independent variables significantly contribute to the variability in additional charge. This is critical to explore the relative importance of different factors. This technique also allows for the assessment of variable importance. I can prioritize the most influential factors impacting additional charges by examining the coefficients and their significance.  
#### STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
The p-values of the reduced model and the F-statistic are essential to assessing the statistical significance. The p-values should be very small to indicate that the variable is statistically significant in predicting additional charges. All the corresponding variables chosen are below the significance level (0.05). Also, the overall reduced model’s F-statistic has a very low p-value. This suggests that at least one predictor variable contributes significantly to the variability.
Since both metrics are statistically significant, this implies that the observed relationships are unlikely to have occurred by chance alone. The results are more likely due to the relationships between variables. This strengthens the validity and reliability of the model.
#### PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
It is crucial to find the practical significance of the model to focus on the relevance of the results. The model suggests that age, complication risk, high blood, and stroke are significant factors that influence additional charges. Older patients should expect higher charges in their hospital bills. Moreover, patients with medium and high complication risk levels should expect higher additional charges. Patients with the medical condition of high blood and stroke should be wary of the additional financial impact on their hospital bills. 
The model’s practical significance is its ability to identify specific patient characteristics directly impacting healthcare costs. Practical significance is found in understanding these variables' effects on patients and healthcare professionals. It can help with resource allocation, budgeting, and patient care planning.
#### LIMITATIONS OF THE ANALYSIS 
It is vital to be aware of the limitations of the analysis. The transformation of categorical variables in regression analysis is one of the potential limitations. Firstly, the dataset may lose some information inherent in the categories. In this analysis, this transformation is evident for variables like high blood and stroke, and potential complication risk. Moreover, recoding categorical variables into numerical values might lead to a loss of meaningful information. Assigning 1 to Yes and 0 to No may not capture the nuances of each category. This can lead to a risk of misinterpretation. Users of the model may interpret the binary if not adequately communicated. 
Furthermore, the linear regression model assumes a linear relationship between predictors and the response variable. If the true relationship is non-linear, the model may not capture the complexity of the data. It is also important to note causation and correlation. The analysis identifies an association between predictor values and additional charges but does not establish causation. Lastly, the final reduced model simplifies the true underlying relationships. While this simplification aids interpretation, it may overlook nuanced interactions present in the data.
####  RECOMMENDATIONS 
Based on the regression analysis where I identified the significant predictors for additional charges on the hospital bill, I have several recommendations for the organization. 
It is crucial to integrate regression findings into clinical decision support systems. Ensure that healthcare professionals are aware of the significant predictors. Training can support a more informed approach to patient care. Also, consider allocating resources based on identified risk factors. The organization should prioritize resources and preventive measures for patients with a patient with higher complication risk and those with a history of high blood and stroke. 
It is widely known that prevention is better than cure. The organization should implement strategies to engage patients. Actively involve patients in their care plans, especially those with identified risk factors. Patient engagement can contribute to better health outcomes. Also, there is a need to develop patient education programs. Teach patients about the importance of preventive measures. It should be highly emphasized that this initiative is all for the sake of patients. This not only reduces their hospital bills but improves their overall quality of life. 
These recommendations gained from the analysis are to enhance the effectiveness of healthcare and improve patient outcomes. It is vital that the organization implement these recommendations with a focus on continuous improvement and further development in alignment with its mission and values.
